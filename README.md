This is an initcpio hook to add support for decrypting LUKS with PGP smartcards like a YubiKey.

This is also pushed to the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/initramfs-pgp-encrypt

I recommend setting up your YubiKey by following this guide: https://drduh.github.io/YubiKey-Guide/

To use this hook, for now refer to the docs in `initramfs-pgp-encrypt.install`

An alternative this was inspired by is https://github.com/fuhry/initramfs-scencrypt
